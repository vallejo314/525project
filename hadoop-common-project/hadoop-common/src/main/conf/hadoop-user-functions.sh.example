# You can do things like replace parts of the shell underbelly.
# Most of this code is in hadoop-functions.sh.
#
#
# For example, if you want to add compression to the rotation
# menthod for the .out files that daemons generate, you can do
# that by redefining the hadoop_rotate_log function by
# uncommenting this code block:

#function hadoop_rotate_log
#{
#  local log=$1;
#  local num=${2:-5};
#
#  if [[ -f "${log}" ]]; then
#    while [[ ${num} -gt 1 ]]; do
#      #shellcheck disable=SC2086
#      let prev=${num}-1
#      if [[ -f "${log}.${prev}.gz" ]]; then
#        mv "${log}.${prev}.gz" "${log}.${num}.gz"
#      fi
#      num=${prev}
#    done
#    mv "${log}" "${log}.${num}"
#    gzip -9 "${log}.${num}"
#  fi
#}
#
#

#
# Another example:  finding java
#
# By default, Hadoop assumes that $JAVA_HOME is always defined
# outside of its configuration. Eons ago, Apple standardized
# on a helper program called java_home to find it for you.
#
#function hadoop_java_setup
#{
#
#  if [[ -z "${JAVA_HOME}" ]]; then
#     case $HADOOP_OS_TYPE in
#       Darwin*)
#          JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
#          ;;
#     esac
#  fi
#
#  # Bail if we did not detect it
#  if [[ -z "${JAVA_HOME}" ]]; then
#    echo "ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and could not be found." 1>&2
#    exit 1
#  fi
#
#  if [[ ! -d "${JAVA_HOME}" ]]; then
#     echo "ERROR: JAVA_HOME (${JAVA_HOME}) does not exist." 1>&2
#     exit 1
#  fi
#
#  JAVA="${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java"
#
#  if [[ ! -x ${JAVA} ]]; then
#    echo "ERROR: ${JAVA} is not executable." 1>&2
#    exit 1
#  fi
#}
